Q: How to test on localhost with type "Subdomain"?

A: Add the following block to your hosts file(/etc/hosts on Unix-like operating
systems, more about hosts file see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_file):

127.0.0.1	www.example1.com
127.0.0.1	sutra.example1.com
127.0.0.1	test.example1.com

Then you can register a username "sutra" or "test" to test by your browser
on "http://www.example1.com/".

Attention, under this mode as using 127.0.0.1 as your IP, you can't test on
an external OpenID-enalbed site(RP) which IP is not "127.0.0.1".


Q: Where is the database schema files?

A: We use Hibernate to generate the database automatically, so the database
schema will be updated if needed. You can disable this by removing the following
block in context.xml(in directory $CATALINA_BASE/conf/[enginename]/[hostname]/,
the file name may be ROOT.xml or others which depends on the application's
context path): 
	<Environment
		name="hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto"
		type="java.lang.String"
		value="update"
		override="false" />
