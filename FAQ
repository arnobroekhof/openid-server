Q: How to test on localhost with type "Subdomain"?

A: Add the following block to your hosts file(/etc/hosts on Unix-like
operating systems, more about hosts file see
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_file):

127.0.0.1	www.example1.com
127.0.0.1	sutra.example1.com
127.0.0.1	test.example1.com

Then you can register a username "sutra" or "test" to test by your browser
on "http://www.example1.com/".

Attention, under this mode as using 127.0.0.1 as your IP, you can't test on
an external OpenID-enalbed site(RP) which IP is not "127.0.0.1".


Q: Where is the database schema files?

A: We use Hibernate to generate the database automatically, so the database
schema will be updated if needed. You can disable this by removing the
following block in context.xml(in directory
$CATALINA_BASE/conf/[enginename]/[hostname]/, the file name may be
ROOT.xml or others which depends on the application's context path): 
	<Environment
		name="hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto"
		type="java.lang.String"
		value="update"
		override="false" />


Q: I'd like to use URL "http://www.example.com:8080/" instead of
"http://www.example.com:8080/jos/", how to do this in Tomcat? In other
word, how to deploy JOS as the default context in Tomcat?

A: The default or ROOT context in Tomcat would be deployed as
ROOT.war (WAR) or ROOT (directory). So rename "jos.war" to "ROOT.war"
and then deploy it to Tomcat. For more information see
http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/virtual-hosting-howto.html#Configuring%20Your%20Contexts
