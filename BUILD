We use Maven(http://maven.apache.org/) to manage JOS.


I. Build
	mvn package

Then you will get a war file in directory "jos-webapp/target/jos-webapp-*.war,
You can deploy it into your servlet container,
such as Apache Tomcat(http://tomcat.apache.org/).

II. Clean
	mvn clean


III. Release
	mvn assembly:assembly

Then you'll get packages target/jos-*-project.*.
