Quick Install Guide

1. Modify the configuration files
    All configuration files are in the directory WEB-INF/config/, and there are
  some examples in WEB-INF/config.samples.

1.1 Database configuration

1.1.1 Copy the jdbc driver libraries into your classpath(WEB-INF/lib
  or ${TOMCAT_HOME}/lib)

1.1.2 Write jdbc.properties
    Copy file form jdbc.dist.properties to jdbc.properties.
    Modify the following parameters(You can choose a template for your database
  such as MySQL, PostgreSQL etc.):
    * jdbc.driverClassName: the jdbc driver for your database;
    * jdbc.url: the jdbc url to connect to your database;
    * jdbc.username: the username to connect to your database, at installation
        time, you should grant create tables, read, write privileges to it.
    * jdbc.password: the password of the user.
    * hibernate.dialect: the dialect of the database for hibernate3.

1.2 Mail sender configuration
    Copy file applicationContext-mail.dist.xml to applicationContext-mail.xml
  and modify for yours.

2. Download JavaScript Calendar and install it
    The calendar if for persona modification page.
    Download from http://www.dynarch.com/projects/calendar/
    Unpack to directory /jscalendar/ in the webapp

3. Package the files as a war(optional).

4. Deploy the war or the webapp directory into your webapp container(such as
  Tomcat).

5. Add domain(s)
    We stored the domain configurations in database. As now, the domain
  management has not been implemented yet. You should add domain info to
  database manually.
    After the webapp deployed, the tables should be created in your database
  automatically. Execute these two SQL sentence:
    * insert into jos_domain(domain_id, domain_name, domain_type,
  domain_server_host, domain_member_path, domain_creation_date)
  values('1', 'example1.com', 1, 'www', null, currentdate);
    * insert into jos_username_configuration(id, regex,
  reserved_username_regex, unallowed_username_regex, creation_date)
  values('1', '[a-z]{1,16}', 'root|toor|admin|administrator',
  'www|news|bbs', currentdate);

    Fields description:

    Table "jos_domain":

    * domain_id: the id of your domain, type is string.
    * domain_name: the domain name of your domain, such as "example1.com",
  "openid.org.cn".
    * domain_type: 1 and 2 is available, type is integer. 1 means the OpenID
  Identifier(url) of the end users are subdomains, for example
  "http://sutra.example1.com", "http://sutra.openid.org.cn";
  2 means the OpenID Identifier(url) of the end users are subdirectory,
  for example "http://www.example1.com/sutra/",
  "http://www.openid.org.cn/sutra/".
    * domain_server_host: the homepage of OpenID server, type is string.
  Usually "www";
    * domain_member_path: the appendix of domain name in end users' OpenID
  Identifier(url), type is string, usually set as database "null".
  For example "http://sutra.example1.com/test/", "http://www.example1.com/test/"
  here "test" is the domain_member_path.
    * domain_creation_date: a date to indicates the creation date, type is
  datetime.

    Table "jos_username_configuration"
    * id: the id must be equals to the jos_domain.domain_id.
    * regex: username regex, in regular format.
    * reserved_username_regex: reserved username, in regular format.
    * unallowable_username_regex: unallowable username, in regular format.
  Attention, if the domain_server_host is setted, the it must be indicated
  in unallowable_username_regex.

    More descriptions of the fields see the documentation of class
  "cn.net.openid.jos.domain.Domain".
    The fields which is or ends with 'regex' are all in regular-expression
  format: see http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html.


Appendix
  How to test on localhost?
  Add the following block to your hosts file(/etc/hosts on Unix-like operating
  systems, more about hosts file see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_file):

127.0.0.1	www.example1.com
127.0.0.1	sutra.example1.com
127.0.0.1	test.example1.com

  Then you can register a username "sutra" or "test" to test by your browser
  on "http://www.example1.com/".
  Attention, under this mode as using 127.0.0.1 as your IP, you can't test on
  an external OpenID-enalbed site(RP) which IP is not "127.0.0.1".
