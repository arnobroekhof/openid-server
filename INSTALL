Quick Install Guide

1. Add JDBC driver JAR, java mail JAR to CLASSPATH.
For Tomcat, you can copy(or link) them to $CATALINA_BASE/lib/.

By default, HSQLDB JDBC driver is required, you can download it from
http://hsqldb.org/, except you're going to use PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.

You can download Java mail JAR from http://java.sun.com/products/javamail/.

2. Deploy the WAR into your webapp container (such as Tomcat, Jetty).
There are several ways to deploy into Tomcat, such as coping the WAR
into the $CATALINA_BASE/webapp directory, using Tomcat 6 "Manager" web
application to deploy and undeploy. More about this please see
http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/appdev/deployment.html#Deployment%20With%20Tomcat%206.

3. Configuration
After deployed into Tomcat, the file /META-INF/context.xml in the WAR
will be copied to $CATALINA_BASE/conf/[enginename]/[hostname]/ and renamed
to match the application's context path(for example, if your context path is
"/jos", then the file is "jos.xml", and if your context path is "/", in
another words the name of WAR is ROOT.war, the file will be "ROOT.xml").
See http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/config/context.html#Introduction

Then you should modify the file
in $CATALINA_BASE/conf/[enginename]/[hostname]/,
especially the database and mail configurations, and the password for
domain configurator(the name of the environment variable is
"domain.configurator.password").

4. Add domain(s)
Open "http://localhost:your-port/your-webapp" or
"http://your-domain:your-port/your-webapp" by your browser, you'll see
"Unresolved domain", navigate the link "configure this domain", then
password is required, the password is configured in the previous step.
