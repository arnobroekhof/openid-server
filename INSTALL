Appendix
  How to test on localhost with type "Subdomain"?
  Add the following block to your hosts file(/etc/hosts on Unix-like operating
  systems, more about hosts file see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_file):

127.0.0.1	www.example1.com
127.0.0.1	sutra.example1.com
127.0.0.1	test.example1.com

  Then you can register a username "sutra" or "test" to test by your browser
  on "http://www.example1.com/".
  Attention, under this mode as using 127.0.0.1 as your IP, you can't test on
  an external OpenID-enalbed site(RP) which IP is not "127.0.0.1".
